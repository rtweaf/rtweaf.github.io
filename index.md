## About me
He/him from Poland. Likes cats (especially my 3 british ones). Interested in programming and biology (abstraction between actual consciousness and the physiological functioning of the brain).
Aspires to be neuroinformatician.
In my free time, I watch TV series, clean things around me (OCD moment :<) and worry about our existence.
When it comes to series, I recommend:
* [The Good Doctor](https://www.netflix.com/pl/title/80176893)
* [Open Your Eyes](https://www.netflix.com/pl/title/81135995)
