# Description
Several people in the class, in order to be better compared to others, kidnapped students so that they would miss classes and have worse grades and attendance.
I discovered it and when they wanted to kidnap me, I unmasked them. I grabbed one of the people and, threatening, told me to explain everything they were doing.
It turned out that the main person in this business was a colleague whom I liked very much, so I left without saying anything. I woke up.
